# To do list

1) Analyse the data again to get the current data from the original telescope data (meaning use the concept to flats to estimate the error and get the same data set from this deduction)
2) Model the lines as 'Gaussian' before the next step
3) Use the concept of 'Thermal Doppler' to get the Gas temperature and velocity distribution
4) Calculate the redshift from the standard data by comparison.
5) Use this redshift to calculate the radial velocity of the galaxy 
6) Use the the distance and the radial velocity to get the radial proper motion of the galaxy.
